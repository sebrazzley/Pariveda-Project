# Pariveda-Project
Submission for my pariveda project
This is a game that I created in which you are running an energy drink pop up shop at UA ( during finals week).
You have 4 days to make the most money possible. (I like the number 4 :) )
Make the best selling energy drink by listening to feedback and adjusting your energy drink components accordingly.
Make a drink that everyone wants to buy!
Dont forget to make sure you have purchased enough cups for the day as well!
Be the great business person I know you can be and maximize your profits to get an A+ game score!
Enjoy the game and happy energy drink selling !!!!
